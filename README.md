## Overiew 

In this challenge we created an earthquake map with three different overlay maps and data regarding earthquake magnitudes. The map was also updated to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. To show the differences in the magnitudes of the earth quakes we utilized a color and radius function to demonstrate their varying magnitudes. Additionally, we provided a third overlay that shed more light on all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.
